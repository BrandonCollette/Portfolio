                Hello, my name is Brandon Collette, a passionate web developer dedicated to producing and delivering high
                quality work. Learned web development and built applications in collaboration with other students at the
                Learning Fuze coding program. Enthused to learn new skills that better the team and myself. Looking to
                obtain a position as a web developer.
            </p>
            <p>
                I had my first experience with coding in high school when I took an AP Computer Science class where I
                had an introduction to JavaScript. After I graduated I was able to get a job at UTC Aerospace where I was
                building parts for Boeing Airplanes using graphite fiber material. And after five years working there I
                knew I wanted pursue a career that I had more of a passion for. I had remembered how much I had loved the
                Computer Science class in high school so I decided I would look into getting an education in web development.
                And after researching different coding boot camps, I had found Learnging Fuze. I then went on to complete
                the Learnging Fuze Coding Bootcamp.
            </p>
            <p>
                At Learning Fuze we were shown how to collaborate on building web projects using HTML, JavaScript, and
                CSS. We were taught how to build our own projects as well as working with others during hackathons using
                Git and GitHub. One of the biggest things I learned at Learning Fuze is that you can always improve your
                knowledge and skills and with that I always ensure that I am eager to better myself and learn new skills.
                I am always practicing and building new projects to enhance my web development skills. I am looking for
                the right company to welcome me in as a web developer. Hope to hear from you soon.
